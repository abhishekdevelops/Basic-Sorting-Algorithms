# 🔢 Learn Basic Algorithmic Thinking by Building a Number Sorter

A JavaScript-based project to implement and visualize **fundamental sorting algorithms**.  
Built as part of the **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification** from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

## 💡 Features
- Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Implements classic sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
- Visualizes step-by-step sorting process
- Interactive and beginner-friendly interface

## 📘 Overview
Sorting algorithms are essential in computer science and web development.  
This project helps you understand:
- The logic behind basic sorting methods
- How comparison and swapping work
- How to break down a sorting problem step-by-step

### 🔄 Algorithm Usage Example

```js
bubbleSort([4, 2, 7, 1]); // Output: [1, 2, 4, 7]
selectionSort([9, 5, 3]); // Output: [3, 5, 9]
insertionSort([6, 2, 4]); // Output: [2, 4, 6]
```
